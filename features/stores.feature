  Scenario: Retrieve store
    Given the fixtures files are loaded:

      | stores.yml          |
    And the user "bob" is loaded:
      | email      | bob@coopcycle.org |
      | password   | 123456            |
    And the user "bob" has role "ROLE_STORE"
    And the store with name "Acme" belongs to user "bob"
    Given the user "bob" is authenticated
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And the user "bob" sends a "GET" request to "/api/stores/1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should match:
